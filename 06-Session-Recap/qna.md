# Session 1 Q&A

Here are common questions students ask during Session 1, along with detailed answers to help you understand the concepts better.

## Blockchain and Algorand Questions

### Q: What makes Algorand different from Bitcoin and Ethereum?

**A:** Algorand has several key advantages:

- **Consensus Mechanism**: Uses Pure Proof of Stake (PPoS) instead of Proof of Work (PoW) like Bitcoin
- **Speed**: 4.5-second finality vs Bitcoin's 10+ minutes and Ethereum's 12+ seconds
- **Cost**: 0.001 ALGO transaction fees vs Bitcoin's $1-50+ and Ethereum's $1-100+
- **Energy**: Carbon negative vs Bitcoin's high energy consumption
- **Scalability**: 6,000+ TPS vs Bitcoin's 7 TPS and Ethereum's 15 TPS
- **Finality**: Immediate finality vs probabilistic finality

### Q: Why is Algorand considered "carbon negative"?

**A:** Algorand is carbon negative because:

- **No Mining**: Pure Proof of Stake doesn't require energy-intensive mining
- **Efficient Consensus**: Validators are randomly selected, not competing
- **Carbon Offsets**: Algorand purchases carbon credits to offset any emissions
- **Renewable Energy**: Many validators use renewable energy sources
- **Net Positive**: The network removes more CO2 than it produces

### Q: What is Pure Proof of Stake (PPoS)?

**A:** Pure Proof of Stake is Algorand's consensus mechanism:

- **No Mining**: No energy-intensive mining required
- **Random Selection**: Validators are randomly selected based on stake
- **Participation**: Anyone with ALGO tokens can participate
- **Security**: Byzantine Agreement ensures security even with malicious validators
- **No Forks**: No chain splits or reorganizations possible

## Smart Contract Questions

### Q: When should I use stateless vs stateful smart contracts?

**A:** Choose based on your needs:

**Use Stateless When:**
- Simple validation logic needed
- No data storage required
- Cost is critical (very low fees)
- Speed is important (fast execution)
- Multi-signature requirements
- Time-based conditions

**Use Stateful When:**
- Data storage is needed
- Complex logic required
- Multiple users interact
- State persistence is important
- DeFi protocols or DApps
- Gaming applications

### Q: What's the difference between Approval and ClearState programs?

**A:** Stateful smart contracts have two programs:

**Approval Program:**
- Handles main contract logic
- Processes all transactions except opt-out
- Contains business rules and state updates
- Most important program

**ClearState Program:**
- Handles opt-out transactions only
- Cleanup logic when users leave
- Simpler program with limited functionality
- Optional but recommended

### Q: Can I change a smart contract after deployment?

**A:** No, smart contracts are immutable once deployed:

- **Code cannot be changed** after deployment
- **State can be updated** through transactions
- **New contracts** must be deployed for changes
- **Migration strategies** can be implemented
- **Proxy patterns** can be used for upgrades

## Python and Algorand Python Questions

### Q: Why can't I use regular Python libraries in Algorand Python?

**A:** Algorand Python has limitations:

- **Blockchain constraints**: Limited memory and execution time
- **Security**: External libraries could introduce vulnerabilities
- **Determinism**: All operations must be predictable
- **Gas efficiency**: Libraries might be too expensive
- **Standardization**: ARC4 provides consistent types

### Q: What's the difference between dynamic and static typing?

**A:** Key differences:

**Dynamic Typing (Regular Python):**
- Types determined at runtime
- Variables can change types
- More flexible but slower
- Runtime type errors possible

**Static Typing (Algorand Python):**
- Types determined at compile time
- Variables cannot change types
- Less flexible but faster
- Compile-time type errors

### Q: Why do I need to compile Algorand Python code?

**A:** Compilation is necessary because:

- **TEAL Generation**: Python code is compiled to TEAL bytecode
- **Optimization**: Code is optimized for the AVM
- **Type Checking**: Types are validated during compilation
- **Gas Efficiency**: Compiled code uses less gas
- **Deployment**: Only compiled code can be deployed to blockchain

## ARC4 Questions

### Q: What is ARC4 and why do I need it?

**A:** ARC4 is Algorand's type system:

- **Type Safety**: Prevents type-related errors
- **Interoperability**: Allows contracts to work together
- **Standardization**: Provides consistent data formats
- **Performance**: Optimizes data storage and processing
- **Developer Experience**: Better tooling and debugging

### Q: Can I use regular Python types in Algorand Python?

**A:** No, you must use ARC4 types:

- **UInt64** instead of int
- **String** instead of str
- **Account** instead of address strings
- **Asset** instead of asset IDs
- **StaticArray/DynamicArray** instead of lists

### Q: How do I convert between ARC4 types?

**A:** Use explicit conversion:

```python
# UInt64 to String
amount: UInt64 = UInt64(1000)
amount_str: String = String(str(amount))

# String to UInt64
amount_str: String = String("1000")
amount: UInt64 = UInt64(int(amount_str))

# String to Bytes
text: String = String("hello")
data: Bytes = Bytes(text.encode())
```

## Development Questions

### Q: How do I test my smart contracts?

**A:** Testing strategies:

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions
- **Integration Tests**: Test full workflows
- **Testnet Deployment**: Test on Algorand testnet
- **Local Testing**: Use AlgoKit for local development
- **Edge Cases**: Test boundary conditions

### Q: What tools should I use for Algorand development?

**A:** Recommended tools:

- **AlgoKit**: Development framework
- **VS Code**: Code editor with Python extension
- **Algorand Studio**: Visual development environment
- **Algorand Wallet**: For testing transactions
- **AlgoExplorer**: For viewing transactions

### Q: How do I deploy my smart contracts?

**A:** Deployment process:

1. **Write Code**: Create your smart contract
2. **Compile**: Use Puya compiler
3. **Test**: Test on testnet first
4. **Deploy**: Use AlgoKit or SDK
5. **Monitor**: Track contract execution

## Error Handling Questions

### Q: How do I handle errors in Algorand Python?

**A:** Error handling strategies:

- **Input Validation**: Check all inputs manually
- **Return Codes**: Use return values to indicate success/failure
- **State Validation**: Verify state before operations
- **Transaction Failure**: Let transactions fail for invalid operations
- **No Try-Catch**: Cannot use try-except blocks

### Q: What happens when my smart contract fails?

**A:** When a smart contract fails:

- **Transaction Reverted**: Transaction is not executed
- **State Unchanged**: No state changes occur
- **Gas Consumed**: Gas is still consumed
- **Error Logged**: Error is recorded on blockchain
- **User Notified**: User receives failure notification

## Performance Questions

### Q: How can I optimize my smart contracts for gas efficiency?

**A:** Optimization strategies:

- **Minimize State Operations**: State operations are expensive
- **Use Local State**: When possible instead of global state
- **Optimize Loops**: Avoid expensive nested loops
- **Use Constants**: Constants are cheaper than variables
- **Batch Operations**: Combine multiple operations

### Q: What are the gas limits for smart contracts?

**A:** Gas limits:

- **Transaction Gas Limit**: 70,000 gas per transaction
- **Block Gas Limit**: Varies by network
- **Contract Gas Limit**: Depends on complexity
- **State Gas Limit**: Limited by storage costs
- **Execution Gas Limit**: Limited by operation costs

## Security Questions

### Q: How do I secure my smart contracts?

**A:** Security best practices:

- **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs
- **Access Control**: Check permissions
- **State Validation**: Verify state before changes
- **Error Handling**: Handle all error cases
- **Testing**: Test thoroughly before deployment

### Q: What are common smart contract vulnerabilities?

**A:** Common vulnerabilities:
