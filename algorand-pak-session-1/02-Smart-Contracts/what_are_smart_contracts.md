# What Are Smart Contracts?

Smart contracts are self-executing programs that run on a blockchain. They automatically execute when predetermined conditions are met, without the need for intermediaries like lawyers, banks, or other third parties.

## The Vending Machine Analogy

Think of a **vending machine**:

1. **You insert money** (input)
2. **You select a product** (condition)
3. **The machine automatically gives you the product** (execution)
4. **No human intervention needed** (automation)

Smart contracts work the same way:
- **Input**: Transaction data
- **Condition**: Predefined rules
- **Execution**: Automatic processing
- **Output**: Result (approve/reject)

## How Smart Contracts Work

### Step 1: Contract Creation
```
Developer writes contract code
↓
Contract is deployed to blockchain
↓
Contract gets a unique address
```

### Step 2: Contract Interaction
```
User sends transaction to contract
↓
Contract receives transaction data
↓
Contract checks conditions
↓
Contract executes logic
↓
Contract returns result (approve/reject)
```

### Step 3: State Update
```
If approved:
- Blockchain state is updated
- Transaction is recorded
- Changes are permanent

If rejected:
- No state changes
- Transaction fails
- User is notified
```

## Smart Contract Characteristics

### 1. **Self-Executing**
- No human intervention required
- Runs automatically when triggered
- Cannot be stopped once deployed

### 2. **Deterministic**
- Same input always produces same output
- Predictable behavior
- No randomness (unless explicitly programmed)

### 3. **Immutable**
- Code cannot be changed after deployment
- Rules are permanent
- Trust through code, not people

### 4. **Transparent**
- Code is visible to everyone
- All transactions are public
- No hidden logic

### 5. **Decentralized**
- Runs on multiple nodes
- No single point of failure
- Distributed execution

## Real-World Examples

### 1. **Escrow Service**
```python
# Simplified escrow contract
def escrow_contract():
    # Buyer sends money to contract
    # Seller ships product
    # Buyer confirms receipt
    # Contract releases payment to seller
    
    if buyer_confirms_receipt:
        release_payment_to_seller()
    elif dispute_period_expired:
        release_payment_to_buyer()
    else:
        wait_for_confirmation()
```

### 2. **Insurance Claims**
```python
# Automated insurance payout
def insurance_contract():
    # Policyholder pays premium
    # Event occurs (accident, damage)
    # Contract verifies event
    # Contract automatically pays claim
    
    if event_verified and policy_active:
        payout_amount = calculate_payout()
        transfer_to_policyholder(payout_amount)
    else:
        reject_claim()
```

### 3. **Supply Chain Tracking**
```python
# Product authenticity verification
def supply_chain_contract():
    # Manufacturer creates product record
    # Each transfer is recorded
    # Consumer can verify authenticity
    # Tamper-proof history
    
    if product_exists and chain_of_custody_valid:
        return "Authentic"
    else:
        return "Counterfeit"
```

### 4. **Decentralized Voting**
```python
# Transparent voting system
def voting_contract():
    # Voters cast votes
    # Votes are recorded immutably
    # Results are automatically calculated
    # No manipulation possible
    
    if voting_period_active and voter_eligible:
        record_vote(voter, choice)
    else:
        reject_vote()
```

## Smart Contract vs Traditional Contracts

| Aspect | Traditional Contract | Smart Contract |
|--------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Execution** | Manual | Automatic |
| **Enforcement** | Courts/Lawyers | Code/Blockchain |
| **Cost** | High (legal fees) | Low (gas fees) |
| **Speed** | Slow (weeks/months) | Fast (seconds/minutes) |
| **Transparency** | Private | Public |
| **Trust** | Trust institutions | Trust code |
| **Global** | Jurisdiction limited | Global |
| **24/7** | Business hours | Always available |

## Common Smart Contract Patterns

### 1. **State Machine Pattern**
```python
# Contract with different states
class VotingContract:
    def __init__(self):
        self.state = "CREATED"
        self.votes = {}
    
    def start_voting(self):
        if self.state == "CREATED":
            self.state = "ACTIVE"
    
    def cast_vote(self, voter, choice):
        if self.state == "ACTIVE":
            self.votes[voter] = choice
    
    def end_voting(self):
        if self.state == "ACTIVE":
            self.state = "COMPLETED"
```

### 2. **Factory Pattern**
```python
# Contract that creates other contracts
class TokenFactory:
    def create_token(self, name, symbol, supply):
        new_token = Token(name, symbol, supply)
        self.tokens.append(new_token)
        return new_token.address
```

### 3. **Proxy Pattern**
```python
# Contract that delegates to implementation
class ProxyContract:
    def __init__(self, implementation):
        self.implementation = implementation
    
    def execute(self, function_name, *args):
        return getattr(self.implementation, function_name)(*args)
```

## Security Considerations

### 1. **Common Vulnerabilities**
- **Reentrancy**: Contract calls itself recursively
- **Integer overflow**: Numbers exceed maximum value
- **Access control**: Unauthorized access to functions
- **Randomness**: Predictable random numbers
- **Front-running**: Transactions executed before yours

### 2. **Best Practices**
- **Code review**: Have others review your code
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage
- **Auditing**: Professional security audits
- **Gradual deployment**: Start with small amounts
- **Emergency stops**: Ability to pause contract

### 3. **Testing Strategies**
```python
# Example test structure
def test_voting_contract():
    contract = VotingContract()
    
    # Test normal flow
    contract.start_voting()
    contract.cast_vote("alice", "yes")
    contract.cast_vote("bob", "no")
    contract.end_voting()
    
    # Test edge cases
    with pytest.raises(Error):
        contract.cast_vote("alice", "yes")  # Double voting
    
    # Test security
    with pytest.raises(Error):
        contract.cast_vote("hacker", "yes")  # Unauthorized access
```
